## Overview
Weather for you is a basic React app that is built with Redux. We use the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) and get the weather for a city with either a state or county code such as "Seattle, WA" or "Paris, FR".  We give you a 3 day weather forcast along with a AM and PM of each day posted above the day main forcast.
